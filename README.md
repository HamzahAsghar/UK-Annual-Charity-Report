# UK-Annual-Charity-Report
# Project Overview
This project involved analyzing messy and unstructured donor data provided by a UK based charity. The data was spread across multiple Excel files, each with inconsistent formatting, missing values and unstandardized structures. The goal was to transform this fragmented data into a reliable format for analysis and to deliver powerful visual insights through a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Tasks Completed
# 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Combined multiple datasets into one master file.

Removed duplicates, standardized formats and handled missing data.

Transformed unstructured fields into meaningful, analysis-ready columns.

# 2. Data Engineering with Python
Used Pandas and NumPy for data transformation and preparation.

Created calculated metrics like yearly growth, average donations per donor and top donation types.

Cleaned and validated contact fields (emails, phone numbers, cities, etc.)

# 3. Dashboard Development
Built a feature-rich, interactive dashboard in Power BI to provide insights on:
 Donations by Year, Quarter, Month and Day
 Donations by Country and City
 Breakdown by Payment Method
 Top Donors, Top Projects, and Donation Categories
 KPI cards for Total Donations, Gift Aid, Active Donors and Average Donation Value
 Slicers for filtering by Country, Project, Donor Category, Payment Type and more

# Key Metrics Visualized
Total Donations, 
Gift Aid Contributions,
Donor Count( unique donors),
Top Donor,
Top Project,
Top Country,
Yearly Growth, etc.     

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Microsoft Excel (data formatting and cleanup)
Power BI (data modeling, dashboard design)
Power Query (ETL for dashboard ingestion
